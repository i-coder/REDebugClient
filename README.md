## Requirements
* Xcode 5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* ARC

## Installation

### Server

First thing you'll need to do is to install [debugserver](https://github.com/sosedoff/debugserver) gem:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install debugserver
$ debugserver
```

You can specify host and port in debug server, for instance:
``` bash
$ debugserver -h 0.0.0.0 -p 9000
```

### Install REDebugClient

The recommended approach for installating REDebugClient is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Edit your Podfile and add REDebugClient:

``` bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '4.3' # or platform :osx, '10.7'
pod 'REDebugClient', '~> 1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

### without CocoaPods

There's only one dependency - [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket), so you'll need to add it manually.

## Demo

First, you need to install dependencies using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager in the demo project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

After that, build and run the `REDebugClientExample` project in Xcode to see `REDebugClient` in action.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
RELogConnect(@"localhost", 9000);
RELogClear();

RELog(@"Default");
RELogInfo(@"Info multi\nLine");
RELogWarning(@"UIWindow: %@", self.window);
RELogError(@"Error");

NSDictionary *dictionary = @{@"test": @123,
                             @"demo": @{@"foo": @"bar",
                                        @"var": @2}};

RELog(@"NSDictionary: %@", dictionary);
```
